# Landing Page Starter

A clean, responsive landing page project for practicing HTML and CSS. It focuses on alignment, spacing, color palette, columns/sections, and preventing overlapping elements.

## Features
- Semantic sections: `header`, `hero`, `features`, `testimonials`, `pricing`, `cta`, `footer`
- Responsive layout with Flexbox and Grid
- CSS variables for colors/spacing
- Mobile navigation toggle (small JS)
- Accessible, semantic markup

## Getting Started
1. Open `landing-page/index.html` in your browser (double-click or drag into a tab).
2. Customize text in `index.html`.
3. Adjust colors, spacing, and layout in `styles.css`.
4. Tweak small behavior (mobile menu, year) in `script.js`.

## Customize Quickly
- Change brand name: update `.logo` in `index.html`.
- Buttons and links: search for `.btn` and `href="#..."` targets.
- Colors: edit `:root` variables in `styles.css`.
- Spacing: use the `--space-*` scale for consistent paddings/margins.

## Tips for a Great Design
- Use consistent spacing between sections (`.section`) and elements.
- Keep text width readable (60–75 characters per line).
- Ensure enough color contrast between text and background.
- Test on mobile: resize your browser or open DevTools device mode.
